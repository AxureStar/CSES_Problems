What is CSES?
  Long story short, CSES is a set of algoritmic problems.
  This is the link to their informational page. https://www.cses.fi/problemset/text/2433

What am I doing?
  Im going to be solving problems every couple of days until I complete this problem set, and this is simply a way to store my answers.
  Im coding all of this in C++, and a lot of my earlier code should be worse than the more recent answers (hopefully).

What can you do?
  Nothing much can be done, in terms of adding files or editting files. This is simply a personal project.
  If there are blatant mistakes in the code, or something that could have been done much simpler, id be more than happy to talk about it.
  Im still quite inexperienced so any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you :)
